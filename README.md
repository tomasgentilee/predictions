# Linear Regression
This is a simple and multiple linear regression algorithm using Java with SpringBoot. I also added other internal functionalities to get the job done such as calculating the inverse, Gaussian, matrix product and transpose calculation.

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

# How to Use the Project
The project is very simple to use, from the console you can run the algorithm with the loaded data. The project can be linked to a database by making modifications in the training data of each algorithm.

The simple linear regression model is used to predict the value in degrees Fahrenheit and the standard deviation. The multiple linear regression model uses medical data to make a prediction, but as mentioned above all the input data can be customized.
